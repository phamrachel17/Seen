# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm start          # Start Expo dev server
npm run android    # Start on Android
npm run ios        # Start on iOS
npm run web        # Start on web
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
```

Behavior & Workflow for You (Claude):
-------------------------------------
1. Always propose a plan / architecture **before writing code**
2. Confirm libraries, patterns, or complex logic with me first
3. Keep components small, reusable, and readable
4. Prioritize visual fidelity to wireframes over creative liberty
5. When unsure, propose 2 options and recommend one
6. Never hardcode secrets (use `process.env.*`)
7. Product taste / wireframe interpretation is mine — ask before changing
8. Refactors are okay only if they improve clarity or fidelity
9. Treat this as “vibe coding”: fast, opinionated, product-driven implementation
10.
